# Interview Scheduler

  Application to manage the scheduling of interviews in a school setting. Students can schedule interviews at different times throughout the week and select the person they would like the interview with from available options. Editing existing appointments and cancellations included!

  Mini project made for educational purposes by me, Russel!

    - familiarizing with using useState, useEffect
    - familiarizing with using props, prop drilling, components, etc.
    - deepen understanding of difference/similarities of JSX and HTML
  - Implement integration and end to end testing with 95%+ coverage
    testing frameworks used:
      - story book
      - jest

  - opportunity to learn and use axios
  - continue refining use of JS and related logic
